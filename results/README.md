# Results (Not Tracked)

Pipeline outputs (tables, figures, logs, and run configs) are written under `results/`.

Important: `results/` may contain **per-case labels** (Phase C) and **clinician rating artifacts** if you run the
validation workflows. To avoid accidental disclosure, `results/` is **gitignored** in this public repository.
